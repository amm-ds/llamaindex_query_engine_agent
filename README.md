   cd llamaindex-query-engine-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The agent is configured through the `config.py` file. Here's a detailed overview of the main sections:

### Models Configuration
```python
cfg["models"] = {"llm": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "embedding": "BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5"}
cfg["llm_params"] = {"temperature": 0.3}
cfg["embedding_params"] = {"trust_remote_code": False}
```

- `models`:
  - `llm`: Specifies the LLM to use. "gpt-3.5-turbo" is set as the default for a good balance of performance and cost.
  - `embedding`: Defines the embedding model. "BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5" is chosen for its effectiveness in semantic search tasks.
- `llm_params`:
  - `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the LLM's outputs. A lower value (0.3) favors more deterministic responses.
- `embedding_params`:
  - `trust_remote_code`: A safety setting for the embedding model. Set to False to prevent execution of untrusted code.

### Directories Configuration
```python
cfg["directories"] = {
    "document_dir": "data/vector",
    "json_dir": "data/json",
    "index_name": "collections/storage",
}
```

This section defines the directory structure for storing various data types:
- `document_dir`: Location for unstructured document data
- `json_dir`: Directory for structured JSON data
- `index_name`: Path for the LlamaIndex storage

### Tools Configuration
```python
cfg["vector_tool"] = {
    "rerank_top_n": 5,
    "content_info": "Detailed information extracted from various documents, including metadata.",
}

cfg["json_tool"] = {
    "verbose": True,
    "files": ["customer_interactions", "product_info"],
}
```

- `vector_tool`: Configures the vector-based retrieval tool:
  - `rerank_top_n`: Number of top results to consider for reranking
  - `content_info`: Description of the content type for context
- `json_tool`: Settings for JSON data processing:
  - `verbose`: Enables detailed logging
  - `files`: List of JSON files to process

### Agent Configuration
```python
cfg["agent"] = {
    "tool_choice": ["vector_tool", "product_info_tool", "customer_interactions_tool"],
    "max_function_calls": 7,
    "verbose": True,
}
```

- `tool_choice`: Specifies which tools the agent can use
- `max_function_calls`: Limits the number of tool calls per query to prevent infinite loops
- `verbose`: Enables detailed logging of the agent's decision-making process

### Memory Settings
```python
cfg["memory"] = {
    "use_memory": True,
    "tokenizer_llm": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "summarizer_llm": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "retriever_kwargs": {"similarity_top_k": 3},
    "summarizer_max_tokens": None,
    "token_limit": 256,
}
```

- `use_memory`: Enables or disables the agent's memory system. Set to True for a more conversational experience, or False for a task-oriented approach without context retention.
- `tokenizer_llm` and `summarizer_llm`: Specify the models used for tokenization and summarization in memory management.
- `retriever_kwargs`: Configuration for memory retrieval, including the number of similar items to retrieve.
- `summarizer_max_tokens`: Maximum length of memory summaries. None means no limit.
- `token_limit`: Maximum number of tokens to store in memory, helping manage conversation length.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Explanation

## üìä Evaluation

RAGAS framweork is implemented for comprehensive evaluation of the agent's performance. The evaluation process is implemented in `evaluation.py` and includes the following steps:

1. Loading questions and expected answers from `data/questions.json` (in the example there are 'easy' and 'hard' Q&A)
2. Processing queries through the QueryEngineAgent
3. Evaluating responses using RAGAS metrics:
   - Context Precision
   - Context Recall
   - Faithfulness
   - Answer Relevancy

Additionally, the agent evaluation generates a processed response JSON file that includes the reasoning process of the agent, intermediate responses, and tool usage.

To run the evaluation:

1. Prepare your questions and expected answers in the `data/questions.json` file.
2. Run the evaluation script:
   ```
   python evaluation.py
   ```
3. View the results in:
   - `evaluations/evaluation_file.json`: Overall scores
   - `evaluations/qa_scores.json`: Detailed scores for each question
   - `processed_responses/processed_agent_responses.json`: Processed responses with reasoning and tool usage

The evaluation results provide insights into the agent's performance across different dimensions, helping identify areas for improvement.

## üí¨ Interacting with the Agent

The main agent backend is implemented in `agent_backend.py`. It sets up the QueryEngineAgent with all necessary components, including:

- Language and embedding models
- Vector and JSON tools
- Memory system (if enabled)
- Agent runner for processing queries

To start a chat session with the agent:

1. Run the agent script:
   ```
   python agent_backend.py
   ```
2. Enter your questions about the NeoGadget X1 when prompted.
3. The agent will use its tools to retrieve information and provide comprehensive answers.

The agent processes each query through the following steps:
1. Analyzing the query to determine required tools
2. Retrieving relevant information using the selected tools
3. Synthesizing a response based on the retrieved information and conversation context (if memory is enabled)
4. Updating its memory with the new interaction (if memory is enabled)
